Assignment 06 3D Camera
Brandon Shea

The program works according to the assignment document.  You may move the
camera around the sphere with the 'wasd' keys. The movement will occur
when the key(s) is released. You can also zoom the camera in or out with
the 'e' and 'f' keys.  The cube rotates left according to the given rate
and rotation, currently hard coded in the controller file.  I used much of
what was given in the examples as a basis for my program and it is using
the giving linear algebra files.
